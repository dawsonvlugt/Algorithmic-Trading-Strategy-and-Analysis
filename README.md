# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Overview

## Overview
This repository outlines a conceptual framework for an algorithmic trading strategy I developed for Market Movers LLC. It is designed to showcase my expertise in financial data analytics and coding within the realm of algorithmic trading. Due to confidentiality agreements, the specific strategy, code, and proprietary indicators are not disclosed.

## Confidentiality Notice
The details of the trading algorithm and the proprietary indicators developed for Market Movers LLC are confidential. This repository respects the confidentiality agreements and does not disclose any proprietary or sensitive information.

## Indicator Overview
The proprietary indicator developed for this project enhances real-time decision-making for traders by providing visual cues that signal potential trading opportunities. The specifics of this indicator are proprietary and thus are not detailed here.

## Performance Metrics
The trading strategy has demonstrated robust performance under simulated conditions. Here are the key metrics:
- **Win Rate**: 64.3% - Indicates a high probability of successful trades.
- **Profit Factor**: 1.8 - The total profits from winning trades are 1.8 times the total losses from losing trades.
- **Risk to Reward Ratio**: 1:1 - Signifies that the potential reward from a trade is equivalent to the potential risk.

## Strategic Insights and Simulations
After sharing these performance metrics with the founder of Market Movers LLC, we conducted a series of simulations to evaluate the strategy's applicability to various proprietary trading firms with different trading rules. A custom-built simulator was used to analyze the strategy's performance across different prop firm accounts, resulting in:
- **Prop Firm Challenge Pass Rate**: 80% - Demonstrates the strategy's high adaptability and effectiveness under the stringent conditions of prop firm challenges.

These simulations helped us understand the strategyâ€™s potential scalability and its adaptability to different trading environments.
